# README

This tutorial is meant to be led by an instructor with learners who participate with web browsers.
This tutorial should be ideal for students who may be using school-provided, tightly-controlled laptops.

This tutorial uses remote workstations provided by **GitHub Codespaces**. There is a free tier, but students get it for free with the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

Before the class or YouTube video starts, click the following since it will take **10 minutes** for your workstation to be ready:
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/diskuv/2025a-1-tutorial-for-codespaces?quickstart=1)

You are ready when you see a webpage in your remote workspace editor that says **Welcome to Scout Training**:
