# README

This tutorial is meant to be led by an instructor with learners who participate with web browsers.
This tutorial should be ideal for students who may be using school-provided, tightly-controlled laptops.

There will be a second tutorial for the same content on a local PC.

This tutorial uses **GitHub Codespaces**. There is a free tier, but students get it for free with the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
